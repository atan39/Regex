## Regex Components

### Anchors
The characters `^`, `$`are anchors.  

- `^` is the beginning of a string or line
- `$` is the end of a string or line

#### Example
- For example, we could use the words amazing and panda. Using `/^a` it would only match amazing because it has an a at the beginning of the word. 

- If we used `/a$` the word panda would work here since the string ends with a.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many characters or symbols is needed to be a match for an input. 

### Grouping Constructs

### Bracket Expressions

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
